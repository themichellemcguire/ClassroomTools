# E-ClassroomTools
<br>
<p>Deployed app: https://e-classroomtools.herokuapp.com/ </p>
<br>
<p>E-ClassroomTools is a platform for preschool teachers to use to document learning of their students. Because of their non-traditional "grading" system, preschool teachers need an easy way to keep track of their students' progress. E-ClassroomTools allows teachers to login and see their class list. After clicking on a student, they'll be taken to that student's personal information which is useful to have in emergencies. 
<p>For the future, the teacher will also be able to click a button which will take them to a form that has checklists and text input abilities for comments. Teachers will also be able to upload images of students' work, or images of students' activities.
<p>Further into the future, teachers will be able to share their documentation with parents in an easy to read document. This information will be part of the students' records so the next teachers will know what the student is working on.
